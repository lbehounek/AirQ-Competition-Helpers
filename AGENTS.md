# Frontend
- Material UI v7, light appearance
- Mapbox, Maplibre, Leaflet
- Vite + React

# Versioning
- branching model with pull requests
- conventional commits
- do not commit until instructed - code must be fully working before comitting

# Code
- use clear modular architecture
- separate 
- use functional programming as much as possible
- when dealing with a complex problem that is not resolved within first 5 prompts, be sure to go in detail and go step-by-step through the whole algorithm to examine carefully what is wrong and where - do not guess!
- respect DRY and KISS principles
- if unsure, ask the user, do not guess!
- reuse existing logic as much as possible, prefer to extend functions scope in for greater flexibility instead of adding new, very similar functions
