## Adding New Tools

When adding new competition helpers:

1. Create new directories:
   ```
   backend/your-tool-name/
   frontend/your-tool-name/
   ```

2. Update `dev.sh` to include your new services

3. Update this README with documentation

## UI change: Welcome instructions banner (AutoBanner)

- The welcome instructions banner at the bottom of the Photo Helper is now hidden by default to reduce visual clutter.
- It is not removed; it remains in the DOM with display: none so it can be re-enabled anytime.
- Location: `frontend/photo-helper/src/AppApi.tsx`
- How to re-enable:

```ts
// AppApi.tsx
const SHOW_WELCOME_INSTRUCTIONS = true; // set to true to show the banner again
```

Current default value is `false`.
