# AirQ Competition Helpers

Software for FAI competitions. Currently supports Rally Flying, with plans to add Precision Flying very soon and Microlight competitions shortly after (they are close to these navigation disciplines within GAC).

## Overview

There are two public tools today. A third tool is planned but will remain private. Its backend will not be published; however, any related frontend code will live in this repository.

All current public tools are frontend-only. They do not require a backend. Persistence across reloads and across private sessions is implemented via OPFS (Origin Private File System).

## Tools

### üì∏ Photo Helper (frontend-only)
Comprehensive photo editor to process, organize, edit, and prepare photos for printing for FAI competitions ‚Äî both track and turning photos.

Features:
- Photo upload and organization (e.g., 3x3 grids)
- Real-time photo adjustments (brightness, contrast, sharpness, white balance)
- Modes for Track photos and Turning Point photos
- Competition metadata and labeling
- PDF export with Czech character support
- Internationalization (English/Czech)
- Persistence via OPFS, no backend required

Location: `frontend/photo-helper`

### üó∫Ô∏è MapCorridors (Rally Flying, frontend-only)
Determines whether a photo location is inside the allowed photo corridor per rules, places a marker at that position, and automatically generates an answer sheet based on input data.

Current input support: KML used in Czech competitions. If support for other KML variants or GPX inputs is feasible for you, feel free to open a pull request. We can also discuss privately developing such support.

Location: `frontend/map-corridors`

### Planned (private) third tool
Will be used to generate relay instructions for construction, which is feasible to do algorithmically. Unlike the two tools above, it will use a backend, so it will not be exposed for public use for now. Related frontend code may appear here; the backend will remain private.

## Project Structure

There are additional backend-related directories in this repository used historically and for experimentation. They are not required for running the two public tools described above.

## Quick Start (frontend tools)

Photo Helper
```bash
cd frontend/photo-helper
npm install
npm run dev
```

MapCorridors
```bash
cd frontend/map-corridors
npm install
npm run dev
```

## Deployment

Development server
```bash
./deploy.dev.sh
```

Production server
```bash
./deploy.prod.sh
```

Make sure to configure `deploy.conf` based on your environment.

## Notes on authorship

LLMs were used heavily during development. While the overall architecture, approach, and direction were provided and supervised manually, approximately 99% of the code was generated by LLMs. Care is taken to follow good programming practices, including clear structure, security practices, modularization, and maintainability to support future development.
